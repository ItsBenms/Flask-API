Bugs

- Sometimes UpdateUserPop function gets stuck and browser cache has to be cleared, haven't tracked down the
  fault currently.

- If the above error occurs you can also run into an issue using the delete button where it wont update
  the front end.

* Issue occurs when you add a new user, if you select and delete and existing user it works fine.
  Once new user is added the code sometimes runs into this bug.
